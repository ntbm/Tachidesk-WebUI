## Hold up!
If you got here hoping to download Tachidesk-WebUI, go back and download [Tachidesk-Server](https://github.com/Suwayomi/Tachidesk-Server), Tachidesk-WebUI is distributed as an embedded web interface along with Tachidesk-Server.

# Tachidesk-WebUI
WebUI doesn't have it's own Tachidesk distribution and is version locked by Tachidesk-Server, In other words the Tachidesk-WebUI distribution is actually the Tachidesk-Server distribution.

You can find minified builds of WebUI in [Tachidesk-WebUI-preview](https://github.com/Suwayomi/Tachidesk-WebUI-preview)

# About
